# PyBer_Analysis
Ride sharing analysis

#Overview
The analysis contained herein is based on ride-share data for the company PyBer from January 1, 2019 thorugh May 1, 2019. The data included details such as the date of the ride, city the ride was located in, ride id's, number of drivers, and the price of the ride. The data was provided in two seperate csv fiules that were imported into one large data frame for analysis. The data was analyzed based on a city type basis (Urban, Suburban, and Rural). 

#Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to identify trends in the data using matplotlib's graphing tools to provide suggestions to upper management regarding PyBer's business. 

#Analysis
During the analysis several graphs and charts were made to help relay trends in the data. The first graph represents the average fare versus the total number of rides per city. The bubble plot is scaled by a factor of 10 based on driver count. As shown below, ride fares typicaly decrease with an increase in driver count and total number of rides.

The next figure is a box-and-whisker plot which shows the distributiuon of the number of riders per city, based on the city type. On average, from January 1, 2019 to May 1, 2019, PyBer had 24 rdiers for Urban cities, 17 riders for suburban cities, and 6 riders for rural cities. West Angela had the highest rider count with 39.

Figure 3 shows a distribution of average fares per city buyt city type. Urban cities were the least expensive with an average cost of just under $24 per ride, followed by suburban cities atroughly $31 per ride, and rural cities were the most expensive at $37 per ride.

Figure 4 shows the average driver count per city based on city type. As shown, urban. cities have the highest average driver count around 38, followed by suburban around 17, and rural with 4.

Figure 5 is a pie chart which shows percent of total fares by city type. It is clear that the highest revenue generators for PyBer are urban cities with 62.7%, followed by suburban at 30.5%, and rural at 6.8%.

Figure 6 shows the % of total rides by city type, which closely follows the pattern of figure 5.

Figure 7 shows the % of total drivers by city type, which as expected urban drivers make up the vast majority at 80.9%, followed by suburban drivers at 16.5%, and rural drviers at 2.6%.

#Challenge Analysis
In the challenge the data was further analysised to at total ride fare by city type over the first 4 months of the year. The graph below shows that revenues from urban cities far outweigh revenues from suburban and rural cities.

#Results
As shown in the graphs and charts above, the vast majority of revenue comes from urban cities due primarily to the volume of ride comeared to suburban and rural citites. Revenue per ride is actually highest in rural cities, but there is not enough ride volume in rural cities to make a major impact on revenues. Additionally this is likely due to the shortage of drivers and length of rides. 

#Summary
I would recommend to the CEO that we primarily try to expand in the urban and suburban cities. The urban cities have such a high volume of rides and drivers available, that this market  should continue to grow and will likely remian the leading revenue generator. Suburban cities are the market that I would try to market toward because they have.
