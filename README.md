# PyBer_Analysis
Ride sharing analysis

#Overview
The analysis contained herein is based on ride-share data for the company PyBer from January 1, 2019 thorugh May 1, 2019. The data included details such as the date of the ride, city the ride was located in, ride id's, number of drivers, and the price of the ride. The data was provided in two seperate csv fiules that were imported into one large data frame for analysis. The data was analyzed based on a city type basis (Urban, Suburban, and Rural). 

#Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to identify trends in the data using matplotlib's graphing tools to provide suggestions to upper management regarding PyBer's business. 

#Analysis
During the analysis several graphs and charts were made to help relay trends in the data. The first graph represents the average fare versus the total number of rides per city. The bubble plot is scaled by a factor of 10 based on driver count. As shown below, ride fares typicaly decrease with an increase in driver count and total number of rides.

The next figure is a box-and-whisker plot which shows the distributiuon of the number of riders per city, based on the city type. On average, from January 1, 2019 to May 1, 2019, PyBer had 24 rdiers for Urban cities, 17 riders for suburban cities, and 6 riders for rural cities. West Angela had the highest rider count with 39.
